## About

OpenTPW is a re-implementation of Theme Park World, requiring an installation the original game and its assets in order to run. OpenTPW aims to re-create the same experience as the original game. While OpenTPW was initially created as it is quite difficult to get Sim Theme Park to run on modern hardware and on a modern operating system, it also aims to somewhat re-introduce the original online aspect of the game - the servers of which have since been shut down.

**In order to run OpenTPW, you must have a full legal copy of any version of the original game.**

## Status

OpenTPW is currently in a very early stage of development, and is not yet playable.
